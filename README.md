# Owl

This is a really tiny project that loads any webpage you want. In this case though, the idea of the app was to quickly solve the issue of connecting to Home Assistant without using their app. It can also load any other webpage you need (think cameras, and loads of other useful things). As such, think of it like a handy spot to easily access your most-used websites without having the extra hastle of opening up your browser and trying to find the right url there. 

# Usage

To start using the app, swipe up to select which urls you want to view. You can add one by using the plus button, remove one by swiping the item to the right or to the left and select one by pressing the link button. Then, when you want to consult the webpage you've selected, swipe back down. Simplicity at it's worst (just have a look at the code, you'll see what I mean... Though perhaps we have differing opinions on complexity...).
